# FortranMbdVector

Fortran application for the dynamic simulation a single rigid body. Some of the highlights of the code are:

 - Momentum based state vector.
 - Handles a single contact with the floor, including coefficient of restitution and friction.
 - Custom vector/matrix/quaternion types
 - Speed is about 2M simulation steps per second.
 - Mass properties derived from shape definition (also used in contacts)

Application is also ported to CSharp for comparison of speed and accuracy.
